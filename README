Script to automatically update your scripts in ~/.vim/bundle directory.
Following a KISS principle there are no external config files. All scripts u need are defined internally - in the update script file.
If you want to use your own plugins, just place them in 'bundle/pluginname' dir and do not include plugin name into 'update' file to not to overwrite it while update.

prerequisites:
    git
    vim 7
    pathogen plugin to vim
    python 3.2
    lxml for python 3.2 (python3-lxml in archlinux) - only if you want to receive latest plugin versions

usage:
    1. edit 'update' file and define plugins u need
    2. simply run ./update or python ~/.vim/update

supported:
    1. git repos
    2. *.vim and *.zip files on www.vim.org
    3. vimball archive (*.vba and *.vba.gz)

todo:
    1. add post install hook, so user can define any actions he want to do after installation
    2. add support for tar archives
    3. add support for bzr, mercurial, svn
